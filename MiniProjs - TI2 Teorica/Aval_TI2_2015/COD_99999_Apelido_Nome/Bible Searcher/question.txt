Hello everyone.
So i'm currently making a college project in which at some point i need to load large ammounts os HTML into a div. I'm doing this like so

    $('#output-div').html(codHTML);

Note that the variable "codHTML" is the variable that contains the large ammounts of HTML

The contents of the HTML code aren't much more then <span>, <b> and <p> and text that is retrived by a JSON search.

Here's an example of how it looks:

My problem is that whenever the time comes that i load the html to the div, the page freezes for an extended period of time.
I've investigate this and i can tell that the problem isn't on the JSON search nor it is when i inject the variable contents inside the div itself. The problem remains on the time the browsers take to actually display the results of that injection.

So after extensive research i am sad to say that i have found zero solutions to reduce the page freeze time.

If anyone knows how i can get around this delay, i would really apreciate if you told me.

Thank you in advance.
